# Steps to start a Terraform project and create the resources on AWS are as follows 
  
01 : Create a new directory  
02 : Create a new file named as "main.tf"  
03 : Write up the code to provision the resource  
04 : Go to the terminal and open the directory where the "main.tf" file is sitting  
05 : RUN => $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= access_key  
06 : RUN => $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= secret_access_key  
07 : RUN => terraform init  
08 : RUN => terraform validate  
09 : RUN => terraform apply  
  
And the Resources would be created on the AWS.
